# üëã Welcome!

My name is **Weida Wang (zh: ÁéãËîöËææ)**, and I also go by David. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) majoring in Software Engineering. As a developer and researcher, my primary interests lie in **graph-based machine learning**, **LLM reasoning** and **AI for science (AI4Science)**. 

Over the past few years, I have gained substantial research experience across various domains. I have worked as a research assistant in the [Graph Signal Processing Lab](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/xygk/xygk.htm) at Tongji University, collaborating with AP. [Jin Zeng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jBxf3FYAAAAJ). My journey also includes research stints at the [Intelligent Internet of Things Research Center (IIOT)](https://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/#/)  at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the mentorship of Prof. [Guanjie Zheng](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=jJpqDQIAAAAJ). 

If you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, don't hesitate to drop me an [email](tjudavidwang@gmail.com).

[**Mobile App**](https://www.appcontest.net/) | <strong>CCCC 2023&2024 Award-Winning Work</strong>

- ImagiTale is an AI-driven application designed for children aged 6-8 and their parents. It enhances children's language expression and cognitive development by providing personalized picture book recommendations and encouraging active storytelling. 
- The app is developed specifically for iPad using <u>Xcode</u> and <u>Swift</u>, with a user interface designed in <u>SwiftUI</u>. It employs <u>SAM</u> for dynamic image segmentation, enhancing visual interactivity. <u>ChatGPT</u> generates engaging dialogues, while <u>Swift Speech</u> handles speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion. Additionally, a custom emotion analysis model offers tailored feedback to improve children's language learning through interactive storytelling.
- This project was submitted to the 2024 China Collegiate Computing Contest - Mobile Application Innovation Contest ([CCCC App](https://www.appcontest.net/)), where it advanced to the <u>finals (top 1%)</u> and won the <u>National Second Prize (top 0.4%)</u> and the <u>Best Innovation Award</u> in the 2023 China Collegiate Computing Contest HCL Innovation Competition ([CCCC HCI](http://hci.oppo.com/)).

- The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for rapid and accurate virus detection methods, as traditional PCR-based approaches are often time-consuming and require complex laboratory environments. In response, our project focuses on a novel detection method using the CRISPR-Cas system, which offers a more rapid, portable, and cost-effective alternative, particularly suitable for underdeveloped areas. By targeting viral RNA sequences with guide RNAs (gRNAs) designed for specific Cas proteins, this method provides a promising future for scalable and accessible virus detection.
- To bridge the gap between cutting-edge biotechnology and public understanding, we designed an educational game called CASleuth. This game allows everyday users to learn about CRISPR-Cas technology interactively and engagingly. Alongside the game, we developed a software tool also named CASleuth, tailored for bioinformatics researchers. This tool facilitates efficient database queries and predictions of gRNA efficiencies for different viruses using a deep learning framework based on convolutional neural networks. The web platform serves to promote the project, raising awareness and encouraging adoption among both the scientific community and the general public.
- The CASleuth project was showcased at the 2024 iGEM competition, where it earned a [Gold Medal](https://jamboree.igem.org/2023/results#medals) for its innovative approach in combining education with bioinformatics, enhancing public engagement and advancing virus detection research.
